## 1. Broken Down Requirements

### As an Owner:
- I want new employees to be fully onboarded faster (within 2–4 weeks) so that they can contribute sooner.
- I want the onboarding process to be standardized across all employees to reduce confusion and ensure quality.
- I want to spend less time managing and explaining the same onboarding details repeatedly.

### As an Employee:
- I want a clear, unified process to onboard new clients so I don’t have to guess or create my own steps.
- I want training resources or guides so I can feel confident handling new clients from day one.
- I want tools that reduce the complexity of onboarding and help me focus more on pet care.

### As a Customer:
- I want the onboarding process to be simple and easy to follow so that I can register my pet without confusion.
- I want to know what to expect (documents, timelines, pet care policies) when I join the daycare.
- I want clear communication and faster service during my first experience with the daycare.
