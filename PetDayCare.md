## 1. Broken Down Requirements

### As an Owner:
- I want new employees to be fully onboarded faster (within 2â€“4 weeks) so that they can contribute sooner.
- I want the onboarding process to be standardized across all employees to reduce confusion and ensure quality.
- I want to spend less time managing and explaining the same onboarding details repeatedly.
