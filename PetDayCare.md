## 1. Broken Down Requirements

### As an Owner:
- I want new employees to be fully onboarded faster (within 2–4 weeks) so that they can contribute sooner.
- I want the onboarding process to be standardized across all employees to reduce confusion and ensure quality.
- I want to spend less time managing and explaining the same onboarding details repeatedly.

### As an Employee:
- I want a clear, unified process to onboard new clients so I don’t have to guess or create my own steps.
- I want training resources or guides so I can feel confident handling new clients from day one.
- I want tools that reduce the complexity of onboarding and help me focus more on pet care.

### As a Customer:
- I want the onboarding process to be simple and easy to follow so that I can register my pet without confusion.
- I want to know what to expect (documents, timelines, pet care policies) when I join the daycare.
- I want clear communication and faster service during my first experience with the daycare.

## 2. Questions to Ask the Client

### For the Owners:
- What specific steps are involved in the current employee onboarding process?
- Which parts of the process take the most time?
- Do you currently use any onboarding materials or documentation?

### For the Employees:
- Can you describe your steps when onboarding a new client?
- What do you find most confusing or inconsistent in the current process?
- Are any digital tools used to manage onboarding tasks?

### For the Customers:
- What common difficulties or complaints do customers express during onboarding?
- Do clients fill out any paperwork or forms during onboarding? Is it online?
- What questions do new customers usually ask?

## 3. Assumptions & Validation

### Assumption 1:
Employees currently lack a standard onboarding guide or consistent process.

- **Validation:**  
Ask the owners or employees to provide any documentation currently used. Compare for inconsistencies or missing structure.

---

### Assumption 2:
Client onboarding varies from employee to employee, causing inconsistency.

- **Validation:**  
Interview 3–5 staff members and compare their workflows. Inconsistencies would validate this assumption.

---

### Assumption 3:
The client onboarding process is manual or paper-based.

- **Validation:**  
Request a demo or walkthrough of a real client onboarding scenario. Look for paper forms or verbal instructions.

---

### Assumption 4:
Customers find the onboarding process confusing or unclear.

- **Validation:**  
Review recent client feedback or send out a quick feedback form to new customers. Identify common pain points.

---

### Assumption 5:
There are no KPIs or structured milestones to track employee onboarding progress.

- **Validation:**  
Ask management how they currently track progress. If there are no formal metrics, the assumption holds true.
